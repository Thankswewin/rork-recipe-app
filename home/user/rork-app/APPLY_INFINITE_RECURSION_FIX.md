# APPLY INFINITE RECURSION FIX

## Problem
The conversation system is experiencing infinite recursion errors due to circular references in RLS policies.

## Solution
Run the comprehensive fix that recreates all policies without circular references.

## Steps to Apply Fix

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Open your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to SQL Editor

### 2. Run the Fix Script
Copy and paste the contents of `fix-infinite-recursion-final.sql` into the SQL Editor and execute it.

### 3. Verify the Fix
After running the script, you should see:
- "Infinite recursion fix applied successfully - policies recreated"
- A table showing row counts for all conversation tables

### 4. Test the App
- Try accessing the messages feature
- Create a new conversation
- Send messages

## What This Fix Does
1. **Disables RLS temporarily** to avoid conflicts during policy recreation
2. **Drops all existing policies** that were causing circular references
3. **Creates new, simple policies** that don't reference each other
4. **Re-enables RLS** with the fixed policies
5. **Tests the fix** to ensure everything works

## Key Changes
- Removed all circular policy references
- Simplified policy logic
- Made policies more direct and efficient
- Eliminated the infinite recursion issue

This fix should completely resolve the "infinite recursion detected in policy" error.
