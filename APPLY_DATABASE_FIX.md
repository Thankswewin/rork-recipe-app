# Database Fix for Infinite Recursion Error

## Problem
The messaging system is showing an infinite recursion error (code: 42P17) in the conversation_participants table policies.

## Solution
Run the SQL fix to resolve the circular policy references.

## Steps to Apply Fix

1. **Run the SQL Fix**
   - Open your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `fix-infinite-recursion-policies.sql`
   - Execute the SQL

2. **Verify the Fix**
   - Try accessing the Messages tab in the app
   - The error should be resolved and you should see either:
     - "No Messages Yet" if you haven't started any conversations
     - Your existing conversations if you have any

## What the Fix Does

1. **Removes Circular Policy References**: Drops all existing policies that reference each other
2. **Creates Simple Policies**: Implements non-recursive policies for all messaging tables
3. **Adds Performance Indexes**: Creates indexes for better query performance
4. **Adds Helper Function**: Creates a function to safely get or create conversations between users

## Features Now Working

- ✅ View messages (shows empty state when no messages)
- ✅ Search for users to message
- ✅ Start conversations with other users
- ✅ Proper error handling for database issues
- ✅ Refresh functionality with pull-to-refresh

## Empty State Logic

When you click the Messages button and have no conversations:
- Shows "No Messages Yet" with an icon
- Provides a button to "Find Users to Message" 
- Redirects to the Search tab where you can find users
- Each user has a message button to start a conversation

## Next Steps

After applying the fix, users can:
1. Go to Search tab
2. Search for other users
3. Click the message button on any user profile
4. Start a conversation
5. View all conversations in the Messages tab
